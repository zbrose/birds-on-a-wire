# SEI Project 1 - Birds on a Wire

 **Birds on a Wire** is an educational music game that helps you improve your ear for melodies.  The object of the game is to listen to a distant bird call and match the melody using your birds' beautiful singing voices.  In order to move onto the next level, players must play the notes in the correct order.  


## Technical Plan
  - Use DOM api for functionality 
  - Create a layout using CSS grid laying out the game display and 6 bird elements
  - Create a button that lets the user play the level 1 bird call as many times as they like
  - Use one row of keyboard keys to let user make musical note selections - QWERTY or the like
  - Conditions for winning: Keep track of which notes have been hit and in what order and measure its combination with that of a winning combination
  - Add audio into the functionality - a line of 3 notes for the intital bird call and single notes for user bird choice
  - Create only one level for this project
  - Create a display that will display a message of note choice and if the combination of notes is correct or not
  - Have a simple design - images of actual birds for the birds elements, hoping to animate when the user chooses respective bird and add musical note imagery
  - Create a small display for control instructions
  - Create an instructions page at the game start
