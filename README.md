# SEI Project 1 - Birds on a Wire

 **Birds on a Wire** is an educational music game that helps you improve your ear for melodies.  The object of the game is to listen to a distant bird call and match the melody using your birds' beautiful singing voices.  In order to move onto the next level, players must play the notes in the correct order.  

## Technical Plan
  - Use DOM api for functionality 
  - Create a layout using CSS grid laying out the game display and wireframe elements
  - Create a button that lets the user play the level 1 bird call for reference 
  - Create an instructions page at the game start
  - Hook up audio playback at an event
  - Use one row of keyboard keys to let user make musical note selections - QWERTY or the like
  - Keep track of conditions for winning: which notes have been hit and in what order measured with a winning combination based on the inital bird call
  - If combination of user notes doesnt match order - clear player choice and start over
  - Add audio into the functionality - a line of 3 notes for the intital bird call and single notes for user bird choice
  - Display a message of note choice and if the combination of notes is correct or not 
  - Create a small display for control instructions
  - Have a simple design - images of actual birds for the birds elements, hoping to animate when the user chooses respective bird and add musical note imagery
